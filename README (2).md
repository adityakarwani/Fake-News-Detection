# Rock vs Mine Prediction using SONAR Data




## About 
Fake news detection in machine learning involves collecting a dataset of real and fake news articles, cleaning and preprocessing the text, and converting it into numerical features. Common techniques include TF-IDF and word embeddings. Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or advanced models like LSTM and BERT are trained on this data to classify news articles as real or fake. This helps in identifying and reducing the spread of misinformation.


## Model
The model used here is Logistic Regression. Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable. Logistic Regression uses a sigmoid or logit function which will squash the best fit straight line that will map any values including the exceeding values from 0 to 1 range. So it forms an “S” shaped curve. Sigmoid func. removes the effect of outlier and makes the output between 0 to 1. As it a binary classification model it is perfect to predict if an object is mine or rock based on the sonar data.
